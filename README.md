# Event Liklihood - Predicting if a user would like to listen to music

This project attempts to predict whether a user is interested in listening to music in the current timeframe, given when they have played music in the past. The project makes use of Scikit -earn and Tensorflow.
Methods employed are:
- Logistic regression
- Linear SVM Model
- RBF SVM Model
- RNN-LSTM

The model makes usse of the LastFM 100k user dataset (http://www.dtic.upf.edu/~ocelma/MusicRecommendationDataset/lastfm-1K.html) as well as SQLite for storing the data.
