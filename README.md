# Event Liklihood - Predicting if a user would like to listen to music

This project attempts to predict whether a user is interested in listening to music at current time t, given their past history. The project makes use of Scikit-Learn and Tensorflow.

The model makes usse of the LastFM 100k user [dataset](http://www.dtic.upf.edu/~ocelma/MusicRecommendationDataset/lastfm-1K.html) which was transformed into time-series data and stored in SQLite.

Methods applied were:
- Logistic regression
- Linear SVM Model
- RBF SVM Model
- RNN-LSTM
