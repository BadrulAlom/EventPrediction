# Event Liklihood
## Modeling when users listen to music

This project attempts to predict whether a user is interested in listening to music in the current time, given when they have played music in the past. The project makes use of Scikit -earn and Tensorflow.
Methods employed are:
- Logistic regression
- Linear SVM Model
- RBF SVM Model
- RNN-LSTM
