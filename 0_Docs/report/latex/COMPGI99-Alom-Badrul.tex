While the area of customer recommendations has received a lot of attention in recent years, predicting user behaviour, particularly the timing of their actions, has not had as much focus. The modelling of temporal processes representing human behaviour can be applied across many industries. In this research we examine different methods for predicting whether a user is interested in listening to music based on past listening history. We examine several models: Beta-Binomial, logistic regression, SVM with both a linear and RBF kernel, and a deep-learning RNN-LSTM model. In addition we have a baseline model in which the prediction at time $t$ was assumed to be the same as the previous period, $t-1$. We found that the Linear SVM model achieves the highest precision, while the logistic regression and baseline models achieved the highest recall. Across both metrics, our baseline model performs the best overall. This may be an issue with the framing of the question and/or the nature of the dataset. Some additional analysis performed towards the end in which we sought to predict the start of a play sequence instead, showed that all models performed poorly, indicating a need for more research in this space.
We also found that precision and recall posed a trade-off, with only the RBF-SVM model found to give a good balance on both. 

We conclude our research with things to consider when modelling temporal point processes and future directions for this research.
