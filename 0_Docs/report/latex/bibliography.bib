	Abstract = {Deep learning allows computational models that are composed of multiple processing layers to learn representations of
	data with multiple levels of abstraction. These methods have dramatically improved the state-of-the-art in speech rec-
	ognition, visual object recognition, object detection and many other domains such as drug discovery and genomics. Deep
	learning discovers intricate structure in large data sets by using the backpropagation algorithm to indicate how a machine
	should change its internal parameters that are used to compute the representation in each layer from the representation in the previous layer.},

We have developed an extremely simple laser of this type, built from inexpensive commercial components with only a few minor modifications. A 780~nm laser built to this design has an output power of 80~mW, a linewidth of 350~kHz, and it has been continuously locked to a Doppler-free rubidium transition for several days.},
